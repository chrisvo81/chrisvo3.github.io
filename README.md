## About This Portfolio

I was inspired by @muan portfolio website. Her website was straight up black and white theme.

This speaks `aesthetic`, `simplistic` and `minimalistic` to me, which are my favorite style currently.

I adopted this style of art, then transform my website into simplet yet colorful and personal.

Use `Visual Studio` to work on the project
